# The task
This is the repository of the 5th SemEval 2021 task, regarding Toxic Spans Detection. 

The task concerns the evaluation of systems that detect the spans that make a text toxic, when detecting such spans is possible. You can find more details [here](https://sites.google.com/view/toxicspans). 

Inside this repository you will find a notebook (`ToxicSpans_SemEval21.ipynb`), where a random toxic span detector is used as a system and its results are prepared for submission to the competition.
